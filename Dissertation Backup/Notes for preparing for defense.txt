Things to study and review before defense

Chapter 1



Chapter 2
-What were the pH levels corresponding to the CO2 levels? how much did salinity increase? Other difs between the two experiments
-Why didn't I calculate alpha (and will I)




Meeting with Janet
-Lunch for defense?
	-email mike bob and janet, either janet will pick it up or someone from the lab will
	-i will get snacks
-Where is she staying, does she want to get dinner?
-How to prepare for committee meeting?
-DEB symposium - should I register with MOU P-card? There will be a special issue we can submit to in Ecological Modelling
	-RF - can't use p-card, probably best to just pay and do concur
-Hotspots postdoc meeting
	-Grace seemed to be willing to let me use the glider data but i would have to learn how
	-She has a technician that made the maps, might need to get code
	-Graces' and Charlie's data is publicly available
	-I can use the NYB data but Baoshan and Janet would have to be involved
	-What is Grace's role in this project? If any??
	-Samantha Siedlecki is organizing symposium on monitoring for NECAN, they want to do something in the Northeast
		-She does a lot of modeling
		-Associated with NECAN but still would be good person to talk to
	-Would be good earlier rather than later to figure out what I want to do
	-
-Questions from yesterday
	-Is it really that unbelievable that a threshold could exist between 3600 and 4500?
		-Temperature corrected pCO2
	-Ok to combine Chapters 1 and 2 to make it more brief? Mainly by having a shared conclusions section and leaving out most of the methods for Ch 2.
	-How important is it to show the different treatment levels for each experiment? Like the 3x3 factorial diagrams
		-don't show table, just mention that they are locally relevant
	-What does 'do you really need JA etc for your public talk' mean? I should use words instead of abbreviations?
		-keep kappa because important to show reproduction is whatever is leftover from somatic

Main takehome points to bring chapters together
-OA is important when other stressors are also at play (temp and hypoxia), even if it isn't usually affecting them by itself (give examples)
-Silversides will be resilient because they have mechanisms to respond, but there may be tradeoffs (give examples)
-Many fisheries people wonder why we care about OA for fish but with other stressors also occurring, it is important to think about

Show time series of how these stressors covary in an estuary
-Wallace and/or Baumann papers – and point out how high it goes because that is close to treatments we used
-say it makes sense to study them together since they vary/occur together

-Many people have looked at the more visible effects such as growth and mortality, but few people have gotten into the underlying mechanisms
	-Underlying mechanisms show how they are compensating, or in some cases why they can't compensate
-just cause no effect now doesn’t mean no effect later and vice versa, just because they are affected early on doesn't mean it will have whole life consequences
	-this is why its important to look at the mechanisms in order to go to population level
