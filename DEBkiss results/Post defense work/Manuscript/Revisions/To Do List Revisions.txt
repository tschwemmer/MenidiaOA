Things to try in MATLAB
-Fixing delM at calculated value instead of trying different values
-Different dw at hatching or egg dw
-Different way of calculating dry weight density such as with older fish instead of egg
	-We used egg volume for delM so if I can find volume at a different age we can use that
		-I cannot

Still need to do

-Update references lists
-Update line numbers for track changes version
-Write email
-Update figure 1
-Check equation numbers
