DEB paper to do list
DONE-Remake Fig 3 with new correction factor
DONE-Remove Fig 4-6
DONE-Replace Fig 7 with new results for best fit model (now Fig 4)
DONE-Remove Table 4 - now the methods or intro will explain mechanistically why we chose the parameters we did and why we multiplied or divided it
DONE-Remove the idea of "initial criteria" from the methods
DONE-Replace Table 5 (now Table 4) with one with new results
	-Maybe have a table showing which way the correction factor is applied to each parameter, similar to in Jager book
DONE-Replace Table 6 (now Table 5) with one with new results
DONE-Update intro
DONE-Update methods
DONE-Update results
-Update discussion
DONE-Update Fig S1 with new results for best fit model
DONE-Replace equations for correction factors and description in methods (say that for maintenance and survival the parameter is divided by c instead of multiplied).
DONE-Write abstract

-Make sure it fits the Ecological Modelling requirements and guidelines
-Data availability
-Cover letter and potential reviewers
-Should I make it say "conversion efficiency" or "yield coefficient" throughout, instead of switching between both?


Introduction paragraphs
-Describe why hypoxia effects are important to study 
-Physiological effects of hypoxia 
-Multiple stressor and fluctuation effects on M. menidia
-Population level - maybe remove this paragraph since we do not do population modeling. it could just be one sentence about how DEB is valuable for getting there. 
-Introduce DEB and why it is useful
-Describe DEBkiss
-State our objectives - use DEBkiss to test hypotheses
-HERE add paragraph about synthesizing unit
-Which parameters we hypothesized and why (3 paragraphs) - rework to match new methods and make more concise

Methods
-Remove idea of criteria, and say instead that we only used the hypothesized parameters based on background info (which will be in discussion) and using inhibition and damage to SU. 
-Replace the correction factor equation, and add in some of the steps of how we got it
-Add that we equally weighted the data so that all of the weights in each treatment add up to the same number across treatments. 
-Explain that we only wanted to compare models that allowed hypoxia to affect all three data types, which means either sJAm or yVA had to be included. 
-Explain that for maintenance and survival parameters we divided by c instead of multiply because we hypothesized that these would increase with hypoxia. Think about how this translates into effects on the SU...
-May not need so much emphasis on Akaike weights? Or idk maybe good to leave in since you can make statements about how likely they are relative to each other. 

Discussion paragraphs
-Main finding: conversion efficiency of assimilates into structure is most likely process responsible for hypoxia effects, and including mortality is best
-What was lacking: underestimated time to hatching and overestimated size at age? What information would improve fit
-Assimilation rate gave similar fit to conversion efficiency - CHANGE/REMOVE - difference between the two parameters
-Maintenance turned out not to be a good explanatory mechanism - add stuff about indirect impacts of damage and increased maintenance going into damage repair - does it mean damage repair isn't happening?
-Shortcomings of mortality rates as explanatory mechanisms - MOVE EARLIER - add context more relevant to inhibition/damage/SU
-Implications for populations and ecosystems
-Sum up what we accomplished
