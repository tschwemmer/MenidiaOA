-I added the csvs for embryo, 1dph, and 10mm to the environment and saved the environment so I can easily pull it up each time. 
-First overall goal is to analyze the standard deviations between duplicate counts to see which ones need to be recounted. 
    -I think these data sheets don't include that having already been done at all but I'll have to check for sure. 
    -Embryo definitely doesn't because I pulled it right from the raw data sheets. 
    -Relatedly, I need to figure out how to address outliers (both the overall outliers and outliers identified in the statistical analysis). 
-Next overall goal will be to analyze the average densities for each section and the total fish, with respect to the treatments. 
    -Temperature: 17C, 20C, 24C, 28C
    -CO2: 400, 2200, 4200 uatm
    -Experiment: 1, 2, 3, 4 
    -Section: front, back, total OR yolk, body, total
    -I will have to decide whether to include all and analyze as continuous data, or exclude unbalanced data and use LME models. 
-Third overall goal will be to analyze relationships between ionocyte density and metabolism and gene expression, within and across treatments. 

-Units: for now I will use square mm as the area units. 

-Embryo SD analysis
    -Yolk:There are 4 above 400, 7 above 300
      -Try putting a line at 3 SDs away from the mean SD
      -This line is around 300
    -Body: There is 1 above 800, 2 above 300
      -the line at 3SDs away from the mean SD is also around 300
    -Total: Actually there's no need to do this because I just want to compare duplicate count pairs.
